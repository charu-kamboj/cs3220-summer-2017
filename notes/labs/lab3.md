```

## Descriptions

Your job here is to create the basic server application for the restaurants
application we have been working on in the past from the front-end application
to be back-end supported application.

In specific, you will need to write the back-end application in Java Servlet to
store the information in the application scope so that multiple users can see the
same information from different browser/location.

To do so, you will need a running tomcat server running. Fortunately, in CSULA,
we already have CS3 server with tomcat running. All you need is the credential
to ssh/tcp files over to CS3 server.

> Please talk to me individually to get your credential if you haven't got one.

See https://csns.calstatela.edu/wiki/content/cysun/course_materials/eclipse as
recap on how to run Java Servlets locally or on CS3.

## Requirements

* Deploy code to CS3 server
* User should be able to create food item
* User should be able to see the food items
* User should be able to edit the food item

## Instructions

To get started, make sure you have the following installed:

* Java JDK8
* One of the following:
	* Gradle
	* Eclipse
	* IntelliJ
	* Tomcat

With above two items installed, you should be able to run Servlets locally

Get the HelloServlet going and start hacking!
